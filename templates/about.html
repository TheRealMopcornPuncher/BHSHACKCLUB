    <p style="font-size: 20px">Founded by nerds and technology enthusiasts, the BHS Hack Club is an open community that welcomes anyone to join and participate 
    in unique, fun events! Anyone of any skill level is able to join, so don't fret about not knowing something. At the heart of
    every community is what its people can bring to the table, and thus we bring you events such as hackathons, chances to win
    prizes for your talents or newly learned skills, a space to hang out and try out the stuff you built together, and so much more. So if
    you feel like trying something new (or maybe not so new!), consider joining a meeting; better yet, join the club!</p>
